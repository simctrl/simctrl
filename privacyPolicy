SIMCTRL Privacy Policy

Effective date: August 22, 2025
Contact: simctrl.app@gmail.com

SIMCTRL is a minimalist console to log your day, surface patterns, and set gentle reminders. This policy explains what we ( “SIMCTRL”, “we”, “our”, “us”) collect, how we use it, and your choices.

If you have questions or want to exercise your rights, email simctrl.app@gmail.com
.

1) What this policy covers

The SIMCTRL mobile app (Android; iOS if applicable later).

Our backend services running on Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions).

This policy does not cover websites or services we link to (e.g., Buy Me a Coffee).

2) Data we collect

We aim to collect the minimum necessary.

a) Account data

Anonymous account: a randomly generated user ID (no email required).

Email account (optional): your email address if you sign in or link an email to an anonymous account.

b) App content you add

Entries you create inside the app (e.g., logs/notes/keywords), and simple app metrics you see in the UI (e.g., streaks or progress counters).

c) Feedback

When you submit in-app feedback: the message you write plus timestamp; we may attach your user ID and/or email to respond or follow up.

d) Settings & preferences

Theme (light/dark), reminder time and enabled/disabled state, and similar app settings.

e) Device & usage (limited)

Basic device/OS info and non-identifying event data may be processed by Firebase services to keep things reliable and secure (e.g., request routing, service logs).

f) Local notifications

Scheduled reminders are stored and triggered on your device. Reminder times are stored on Firebase.

We do not sell your personal information.

3) How we use data

Provide the service: authenticate users (anonymous or email), store your entries/settings, show your streaks/metrics.

Notifications: schedule daily reminders on your device.

Support & safety: respond to feedback, diagnose problems, protect against abuse.

Improve the app: understand what features are used (aggregate, non-sensitive signals) to guide development.

4) Legal bases (EEA/UK)

Where GDPR applies, we process data based on:

Performance of a contract (to deliver the app’s core features you request).

Legitimate interests (to keep the service secure, measure basic usage).

Consent (where required by your platform settings, e.g., notifications).

Legal obligations (complying with law enforcement or court orders, if applicable).

You can withdraw consent at any time (e.g., disable notifications in the app/OS).

5) Data sharing & service providers

We use trusted providers to run SIMCTRL:

Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions) – account and app data storage/processing.

Google Play – app distribution, crash/installation metadata per Google’s systems.

Flutter Local Notifications – on-device scheduling (no external transmission).

SharedPreferences (on device) – caches your settings locally.

Providers process data on our behalf under their terms. We do not share data with advertisers.

6) International transfers

Firebase may process data in data centers located outside your country (including the United States). We rely on provider safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) where required.

7) Data retention

Account & app content: kept while your account exists.

Feedback messages: kept for as long as needed to respond and improve the app.

Local caches: remain on your device until you clear app data or uninstall.

When you delete your account (from within the app or by emailing us), we delete or de-identify personal data stored in our systems, except where we need to retain some information to meet legal obligations or resolve disputes.

8) Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

Access, correct, or delete your data

Port your data

Object to or restrict certain processing

How to exercise:
Use the in-app Delete Account function or email simctrl.app@gmail.com
 with your request. We’ll verify identity and respond within applicable timeframes.

If you are in the EEA/UK, you may also complain to your local data protection authority.

9) Children

SIMCTRL is not directed to children under 13 (or the age required by your jurisdiction). If you believe a child provided data, contact us and we’ll promptly delete it.

10) Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures (e.g., Firebase security rules, limited access, TLS in transit). No method is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

11) Your choices

Notifications: enable/disable in SIMCTRL or your device settings.

Account type: stay anonymous or link an email (optional).

Delete account/data: use the in-app control or contact us.

Export: request an export of your data by email.

12) Changes to this policy

We may update this policy as the app evolves. We’ll post changes here and update the “Effective date” above. If changes are significant, we will provide a prominent notice in the app.
